sort1 uses: bubble sort
How do you know?: It was fast on sorted data but very slow on reversed input, matching bubble sort’s behavior.

sort2 uses: merge sort
How do you know?: It ran fastest on all types of inputs — sorted, reversed, and random — consistent with merge sort’s O(n log n) time.

sort3 uses: selection sort
How do you know?: Its performance was equally slow regardless of input order, indicating selection sort’s fixed O(n²) behavior.
